## Definition

[RSA][rsa] is a

>  public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).

???

# Named after Rivest, Shamir, Adleman
# Public-key contrasts private key
# Symmetric contrasts Asymmetric

---

## Outline

RSA is composed of the following steps

--

1. Key generation

--

2. Key distribution

--

3. Encryption

--

4. Decryption

# Generation
# Distribution
# Encryption
# Decryption

## Factorization

> Given a _composite_ number `\(n\)` find factors `\(p, q\)` such that `\(n = p \cdot q\)`

???

# No known polynomial algorithm
# O(2^length n)
# multiplication is polynomial

---

## Primes
A [prime number][prime] is a

> natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

    : List Int
```

## Key generation

Keys are generated by

--
1. Choose two distinct prime numbers `\(p\)` and `\(q\)`.

--
2. Compute `\(n = p \cdot q\)`.

--
3. Compute `\(\phi = (p - 1) \cdot (q - 1)\)`.

--
4. Choose an integer `\(e\)` such that `\(1 < e < \phi\)` and `\(\operatorname{gcd}(e, \phi) = 1\)`.

--
5. Determine `\(d\)` as `\(d = e^{-1} \mod \phi\)`.

--

### Public

* `\(n\)`
* `\(e\)`

### Private

* `\(p, q\)`
* `\(d, \phi\)`

???

# p and q should be large, random and of similar magnitude.

## Key Distribution

### Public

* `\(n\)`
* `\(e\)`

## Encryption

Alice wants to send Beth a message `\(M\)`

--

Alice transform `\(M\)` into a (list of) integer `\(m\)`.

--

1. Alice looks up Beth's public key `\(n, e\)`.

--

2. Alice calculates `\(c = m^{e} \mod n\)`.

--

3. Alice sends `\(c\)` to Beth.

???

# Depends on transformation that needs to be agreed upon.

---

## Decryption

Beth receives a message `\(c\)`.

--

1. Beth looks up her **private** key `\(d\)` and `\(n\)` from her public key

--

2. Beth calculate `\(m' = c^{d} \mod n\)`

--

Notice that

$${\displaystyle m' = c^{d} = (m^{e})^{d} = m^{e\cdot d} = m^{1} = m \mod n}$$
