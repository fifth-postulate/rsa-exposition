## Definition

[RSA][rsa] is a

>  public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).

# Named after Rivest, Shamir, Adleman
# Public-key contrasts private key
# Symmetric contrasts Asymmetric

## Outline

RSA is composed of the following steps

--

1. Key generation

--

2. Key distribution

--

3. Encryption

--

4. Decryption

# Generation
# Distribution
# Encryption
# Decryption

## Factorization

> Given a _composite_ number `\(n\)` find factors `\(p, q\)` such that `\(n = p \cdot q\)`

???

# No known polynomial algorithm
# O(2^length n)
# multiplication is polynomial
