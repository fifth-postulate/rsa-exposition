# RSA
> A toy implementation of the RSA crypto-system.

For an short introduction to the algorithms behind the crypto-system see the [RSA-intro presentation][presentation].

This is primarily used as a teaching aid, delving into the details of algorithm and complexity theory.

## Definition
[RSA][rsa] is a

> one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem". The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978. 

## Future plans
We would like to implement some form of probabilistic primality test.

What is not on the road-map is a user-friendly interface to encrypt a `String`. This is left as an exercise to the reader.
